@misc{Lucks:2008p2672,
author = {Stefan Lucks}, 
title = {{DARX Finder 4 Threefish}},
abstract = {DARX Finder supports the differential cryptanalysis of primitives which use a mixture of 
addition, rotation and xor. DARX Finder attempts to find good xor differences. The two main use cases 
for DARX Finder are (1) analysing existing primitives to find attacks and (2) aiding the designers of new 
primitives to defend against attacks. The current version of DARX Finder aims mainly at supporting 
the developement of the Threefish block cipher.
